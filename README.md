Programs/Applications related to Image Processing 

NB: IMAGE_Edge_Detection.ipynb --> Canny, Prewitt and Sobel Edge detection using opencv
NB: Image_Pre_Processing.ipynb --> The goal of this project is to implement an application that allows to load an image and change apply the following transformations:
 Edge detection (Canny,Sobel, Prewitt)

 Change of contrast and brightness

 Convolution by specifying the weights of the window

 Binarization through the Otsu method
